# Generator

## How the Generator Works

The generator, also known as the Generator Function (G), is a core component of the Bitseed protocol. It is designed based on deterministic algorithms, ensuring that the same Seed value reliably produces the same output results. In the Bitseed protocol, the generation of seeds follows these steps:

* Seed Generation: The seed is a unique identifier formed by combining specific blockchain data, typically a cryptographic hash combination of the Bitcoin network's block hash (BlockHash) and transaction hash (TxHash). Formally, a seed can be represented as seed = H(BlockHash || TxHash), where H represents the cryptographic hash function used, and || denotes the concatenation operation.
* Output Calculation: The generator function G accepts the seed as input and generates an output (Output) by executing the predetermined algorithmic logic. The output may represent assets, props, characters, or other elements of the game world. The generator's output is deterministic, meaning the same seed will always produce the same output.
* Generator Compilation: To ensure widespread compatibility and execution efficiency of the generator logic, it needs to be compiled into WebAssembly (WASM) format and inscribed on the Bitcoin network, allowing any inscription indexer to call it directly during execution.
* Verifiability: As the logic of the generator is public and transparent, all participants can verify the correctness of the output. This is crucial for ensuring the fairness and transparency of the Bitseed protocol.

## API Specification of the Generator

The WASM of the generator needs to provide a set of standard API interfaces for the inscription indexer to call during execution. The following interfaces are expressed in Rust, and the actual WASM interfaces should be consistent with those in the Bitseed JavaScript SDK.

The generator needs to provide two `generate` methods, one for generation during inscription and one for generation during off-chain indexing:

```rust
fn inscribe_generate(deploy_args: Vec<String>, seed: Vec<u8>, user_input: String) -> String;
fn inscribe_verify(deploy_args: Vec<String>, seed: Vec<u8>, user_input: String, output: String) -> bool;
fn has_indexer_generate() -> bool;
fn indexer_generate(deploy_args: Vec<String>, inscription_id: Vec<u8>) -> String;
```

### inscribe_generate

The `inscribe_generate` method is used for the generation of inscription, and its output result will be written into the blockchain.

* `deploy_args`: List of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
* `seed`: The seed, which is calculated based on the first UTXO input of the inscription transaction.
* `user_input`: User input, which will have a value only if the deployment setting `has_user_input` is true.
* Return Value: The JSON content of the inscription.

### inscribe_verify

The `inscribe_verify` method is used to verify the results of the inscription, and the indexer will call it to verify the correctness of the inscription.

* `deploy_args`: List of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
* `seed`: The seed, which is calculated based on the first UTXO input of the inscription transaction.
* `user_input`: User input, which will have a value only if the deployment setting `has_user_input` is true.
* `output`: The JSON content of the inscription.
* Return Value: The result of the verification.

In most cases, the implementation of the `inscribe_verify` method is consistent with that of the `inscribe_generate` method, but sometimes a simpler verification logic can be used for efficiency. For instance, for inscriptions minted through PoW, it may suffice to verify the hash difficulty of the inscription.

### indexer_generate

The `indexer_generate` method is used for off-chain indexing generation, its output result will be saved by the inscription indexer, but will not appear on the blockchain.

* `deploy_args`: List of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
* `inscription_id`: The ID of the inscription.
* Return Value: The additional attributes of the inscription.

The `indexer_generate` method will only be called if the `has_indexer_generate` method returns true. Since its computation needs to wait for the transaction to be on-chain to generate the `inscription_id`, users cannot pre-calculate its output, which can be used in scenarios like opening a mystery box.

## Generator Output Standard

The Output is a JSON that contains four fields:

```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "myworld",
    "amt": 1,
    "attributes": {}
}
```

| Attribute    | Description                        | Required |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| p            | Protocol name, must be "bitseed"   | Yes      |
| tick         | Type, 4-32 characters, case-insensitive | Yes      |
| amt          | Quantity                           | Yes      |
| attributes   | Application-defined attributes     | No       |

This JSON is actually a way of expressing an SFT, which can be used to express both FT and NFT, so it can represent any asset within the game.
