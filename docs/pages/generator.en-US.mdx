# Generator

## How the Generator Works

The generator, also referred to as the Generator Function (G), is a core component of the Bitseed protocol. It is designed based on deterministic algorithms to ensure that the same Seed value will consistently produce the same output results. In the Bitseed protocol, the generation of seeds follows these steps:

- **Seed Generation**: The seed is a unique identifier formed by combining specific blockchain data, constituted by the cryptographic hash combination of the block hash (BlockHash) and transaction hash (TxHash) within the Bitcoin network. Formally, the seed can be represented as seed = H(BlockHash || TxHash), where H denotes the cryptographic hash function used, and || represents the concatenation operation.
- **Output Calculation**: The generator function G takes the seed as input and generates an output (Output) by executing predetermined algorithmic logic. The output may represent assets, props, characters, or other elements within the game world. The output of the generator is deterministic, meaning the same seed will always produce the same output.
- **Generator Compilation**: To ensure broad compatibility and execution efficiency of the generator logic, it needs to be compiled into WebAssembly (WASM) format and inscribed on the Bitcoin network, allowing any inscription indexer to directly invoke it during execution.
- **Verifiability**: Since the logic of the generator is public and transparent, all participants can verify the correctness of the output.

## Inscribing the Generator

The generator is a special type of Bitseed inscription with its tick set as `generator`. Developers need to inscribe the WASM file of the generator onto Bitcoin, making it available for users and inscription indexers to call.

The inscription transaction for the generator needs to include the following fields:

- `tick`: `generator`.
- `op`: `mint`.
- `amount`: 1, indicating it is not fungible.
- `content.content_type`: `application/wasm`, indicating the content is a WASM file.
- `content.body`: The WASM bytecode of the generator.

## API Specification of the Generator

The WASM of the generator needs to provide a set of standard API interfaces for the inscription indexer to call during execution. The following interfaces are expressed in Rust, and the actual WASM interfaces should be consistent with those in the Bitseed JavaScript SDK.

The generator needs to provide two `generate` methods, one for generation during inscription and one for generation during off-chain indexing:


```rust
struct Content {
    content_type: String,
    content: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct InscribeGenerateOutput {
    pub amount: u64,
    pub attributes: Option<ciborium::Value>,
    pub content: Option<Content>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize, Default)]
pub struct IndexerGenerateOutput {
    pub attributes: Option<ciborium::Value>,
}

pub struct InscribeSeed {
    pub block_hash: BlockHash,
    pub utxo: bitcoin::OutPoint,
}

pub struct IndexerSeed {
    pub block_hash: BlockHash,
    pub inscription_id: InscriptionId,
}

fn inscribe_generate(deploy_args: Vec<String>, seed: InscribeSeed, recipient: Address, user_input: Option<String>) -> InscribeGenerateOutput;
fn inscribe_verify(deploy_args: Vec<String>, seed: IndexerSeed, recipient: Address, user_input: Option<String>, output: InscribeGenerateOutput) -> bool;
fn has_indexer_generate() -> bool;
fn indexer_generate(deploy_args: Vec<String>, inscription_id: Vec<u8>) -> IndexerGenerateOutput;
```

### inscribe_generate

The `inscribe_generate` method is used for generation at the time of inscription, and its output result will be written into the blockchain.

- **`deploy_args`**: A list of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
- **`seed`**: The seed, calculated based on the first UTXO input of the inscription transaction.
- **`recipient`**: The receiving address of the inscription.
- **`user_input`**: User input, which will only have a value if the deployment setting `has_user_input` is true.
- **Return Value**: amount, attributes, content.

### inscribe_verify

The `inscribe_verify` method is used to verify the results of the inscription, and the indexer will call it to verify the correctness of the inscription.

- **`deploy_args`**: A list of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
- **`seed`**: The seed, calculated based on the first UTXO input of the inscription transaction.
- **`recipient`**: The receiving address of the inscription.
- **`user_input`**: User input, which will only have a value if the deployment setting `has_user_input` is true.
- **`output`**: The output of the `inscribe_generate` function.
- **Return Value**: The result of the verification.

Generally, the implementation of the `inscribe_verify` method is consistent with that of the `inscribe_generate` method, but sometimes, for efficiency, a simpler verification logic can be used. For example, for inscriptions minted through PoW, it may suffice to verify the hash difficulty of the inscription.

### indexer_generate

The `indexer_generate` method is used for off-chain indexer generation, and its output result will be saved by the inscription indexer but will not appear on the blockchain.

- **`deploy_args`**: A list of static parameters provided at the time of deployment.
- **`seed`**: The seed, calculated based on the block containing the inscription transaction itself and the ID of the inscription.
- **`recipient`**: The receiving address of the inscription.
- **Return Value**: Additional attributes of the inscription.

The `indexer_generate` method will only be called if the `has_indexer_generate` method returns true. Since its computation needs to wait for the transaction to be on-chain to generate the `inscription_id`, users cannot pre-calculate its output, making it suitable for scenarios like opening a mystery box.

## Standard for Generator Output

The InscribeGenerateOutput includes three fields:

- **`amount`**: The quantity of the assets generated.
- **`attributes`**: Additional attributes of the generated assets, optional.
- **`content`**: The content of the generated assets, optional.

The IndexerGenerateOutput includes one field:

- **`attributes`**: Additional attributes of the generated assets.
